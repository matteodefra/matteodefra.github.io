Hi! I recently obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, at 
University of Pisa, Italy. During my Master's studies I had the opportunity to study in depth the big field of AI, getting in 
particular involved with the optimization behind.
Take a look at [about](/about) for more information about me.

I like the applications of operations research to find algorithmic solutions to arbitrary complex problems, sum-structured 
functions and learning problem as what happens in Deep Learning.
My main interests reside in Quantum Computing, Optimization, Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic models for Deep Learning.

<!-- ## Current Experience

I am currently in Palaiseau, France, where I'm developing my Master's thesis as an Intern Trainee at the EdF Lab Paris-Saclay, in the R&D section of the OSIRIS (Optimisation Simulation Risques et Statistiques) departement.

At the OSIRIS departement, optimization is the basis subject to improve the current state-of-the-art of most optimization algorithms. -->
