Hi! I"m a Master's Degree student in Artificial Intelligence at University of Pisa. During my Master's studies I had the opportunity to study in depth the big field of AI, getting in particular involved with the optimization behind.
Take a look at [about](/about) for more information about me.

I like the applications of operations research to find algorithmic solutions to arbitrary complex problems, sum-structured functions and learning problem as what happens in Deep Learning.

## Current Experience

I am currently involved in a national project funded by the Italian Ministry of Justice.    
The project is entitled "Giustizia Agile" and its aim is to bring benefits to the "Ufficio per il Processo".    
The focus is to improve the efficiency of the courts and the entire ICT system of the courts located in Pisa, Leghorn and Lucca.
