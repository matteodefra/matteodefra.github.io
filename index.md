I am a first year PhD student at the [ALGO team](https://algo.unige.ch/) group at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/dinfo/en/), advised by [Arnaud Casteigts](https://arnaudcasteigts.net/).
My research focuses on algorithms for graph problems and motion planning problems, with a focus on computational complexity and probabilistic approaches. I am also interested in quantum computing and learning theory, and the generation of intermediately-hard instances that may help demonstrating quantum advantage.

I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in AI and Applied Math, at University of Pisa, Italy.

From September 2022 to October 2023, I was an intern in the OSIRIS (Optimization and simulation under risks) Lab at Électricité de France (EdF), and after in the Graph Optimization Team at PASQAL.

Take a look at [about](/about) for more detailed information.

<!-- ## Current Experience

I am currently in Geneva, Switzerland, where I'm developing my Master's thesis as an Intern Trainee at the EdF Lab Paris-Saclay, in the R&D section of the OSIRIS (Optimisation Simulation Risques et Statistiques) departement.

At the OSIRIS departement, optimization is the basis subject to improve the current state-of-the-art of most optimization algorithms. -->
