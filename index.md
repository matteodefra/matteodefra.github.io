Hi! I"m a Master's Degree student in Artificial Intelligence at University of Pisa. During my Master's studies I had the opportunity to study in depth the big field of AI, getting in particular involved with the optimization behind.
Take a look at [about](/about) for more information about me.

I like the applications of operations research to find algorithmic solutions to arbitrary complex problems, sum-structured functions and learning problem as what happens in Deep Learning.
My main interests reside in Optimization, Algorithms and Probabilistic models for Deep Learning.

## Current Experience

I am currently involved in a national project funded by the Italian Ministry of Justice.    
The project is entitled "Giustizia Agile", and it's part of an European project called "PNRR". Its aim is to bring benefits to the "Ufficio per il Processo", one section of the italian law courts.    
The focus is to improve the efficiency of the courts by analyzing the current state of the art of the ICT systems and propose suitable solution to improve them, for the courts located in Pisa, Leghorn and Lucca.
