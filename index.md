I am a first year PhD student at the [ALGO team](https://algo.unige.ch/) group at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/dinfo/en/), advised by [Arnaud Casteigts](https://arnaudcasteigts.net/).
My research focuses broadly on theoretical computer science, with an emphasys on quantum computing and graph theory. I am particurarly interested in the development of quantum algorithms for graph-based applications and their compu  tational complexity related aspects.
I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in AI and Applied Math, at University of Pisa, Italy.
From September 2022 to October 2023, I was an intern first in the OSIRIS (Optimization and simulation under risks) Lab at Électricité de France (EdF), and after in the Graph Optimization Team at PASQAL.

Take a look at [about](/about) for more detailed information.

<!-- ## Current Experience

I am currently in Geneva, Switzerland, where I'm developing my Master's thesis as an Intern Trainee at the EdF Lab Paris-Saclay, in the R&D section of the OSIRIS (Optimisation Simulation Risques et Statistiques) departement.

At the OSIRIS departement, optimization is the basis subject to improve the current state-of-the-art of most optimization algorithms. -->
