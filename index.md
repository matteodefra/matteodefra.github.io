Hi! I obtained in February 2023 a Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Applied Math, at University of Pisa, Italy. 
During my Master's studies I had the opportunity to study in depth different subfields of AI, getting in particular involved with the optimization behind.

I pursued two different internships from September 2022 to October 2023. 
First, I interned at Électricité de France (EdF), the main provider of electricity in the whole French country. 
Here, I worked in the R\&D section, specifically in the OSIRIS (Optimization and simulation under risks) department, where they tackle different energy-related optimization problems.
Then, I interned at PASQAL, an upcoming quantum computing company in the Paris area. Here, I developed algorithmic and operations research solutions for the neutral-atom quantum processing unit.
Take a look at [about](/about) for more detailed information.

I'm really passionate about quantum computing. This upcoming technology excites me to think about novel algorithmic strategies to address different real-world problems which are solved nowadays with our classical computers.

My main interests reside in Quantum Computing, Optimization, Algorithms and Probabilistic models for Deep Learning.

<!-- ## Current Experience

I am currently in Palaiseau, France, where I'm developing my Master's thesis as an Intern Trainee at the EdF Lab Paris-Saclay, in the R&D section of the OSIRIS (Optimisation Simulation Risques et Statistiques) departement.

At the OSIRIS departement, optimization is the basis subject to improve the current state-of-the-art of most optimization algorithms. -->
